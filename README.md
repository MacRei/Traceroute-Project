# Traceroute-Project
Built a Python program to analyze tcpdump output, correlating TCP and ICMP traffic to map network routes and measure per-hop latency. Applied deep knowledge of TCP/IP and core network protocols (including DNS and DHCP concepts) to diagnose routing behavior and interpret real-world packet data.
